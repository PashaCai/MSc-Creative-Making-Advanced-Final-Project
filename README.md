<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>If to someone had said to me before, "You'll learn about code and physical installations later on and use those things in your art installations." I would have laughed, I always felt I was a staunch advocate of traditional media and all the graphic work I did as an undergraduate made me embrace that idea even more, I never wanted to get out of that comfort zone. But one day when I realised the limitations of traditional media, I wanted to change. I wanted my work to be more interactive with the viewer, to communicate my ideas to the greatest extent possible, which traditional media could do in part, but as I learned more and more, I felt more and more powerless, so I turned from studying design to art, and then to what was 'beautiful'. But design, art and beauty all need a vehicle, a vehicle for diversity, and so I came to CCI.

In this blog, I'm going to describe in detail the process of creating my graduation project: "Order in Disorder" web-based interactive installation, which can be said to be one of the most difficult project experiences I can remember, bar none :D I can say that from the moment I decided on the theme to now, all the contents are full of challenges for me, but these challenges have made me progress very fast, and this kind of growth is not only my efforts alone, I also have a lot of people to help me from concept to completion, and this blog is a detailed record of the whole project. growth was not just my effort alone, I had the help of many people who helped me from concept to completion and this blog is a detailed account of the whole project.</p>

<h4>Week one:</h4>
<p>This is the last project of my graduate school years and I think I need to figure out what I need to do or what I want to do?

It was a free time due to the fact that I had submitted my final assignment for this semester, so I thought I needed to think about what I really needed to do, and I think that this kind of reflection is good for exploring the purpose of my rootedness.

In the initial topic idea stage, I filled in the form to explore ideas about the spiritual realm of beliefs and the like, and indeed I am very interested in this aspect of the topic, especially in the current social environment where people's spiritual world is incredibly empty (I like to refer to the current social environment as the "Floating World", where people become restless due to a lack of spiritual support). I like to call the current social environment "Fukiyo-e", where people become restless, turbulent and uneasy due to the lack of spiritual support. It seems to be peaceful, but in fact it is a "whitewash", most people's material desires are satisfied in stages, but the pursuit of greater material desires, they become spiritually empty, although this has something to do with the "social winds", but I think that at this stage it is better to let go and look at oneself). (Although this has something to do with "social trends", I think at this stage it's better to let go and look at oneself).

This week I have been reading some books, revisiting Camus's The Myth of Sisyphus, and reading some of Zizek's analyses of the concept of the Big Other, and I want to find a breakthrough in this area.</p>

<h4>Week two:</h4>
<p>Last week wasn't too substantial to be honest, I'm still unsure of the main direction I want to go in, the topic of the spiritual world is too vast and many philosophical books aren't fully comprehensible to me, so this week I decided to look at the work, I'm hoping that browsing through other people's work will give me some answers. I really liked Wellington Lux's work '#entity255', his concept is very interesting: the work explores the mandala as a spiritual concept, a way of creating sacred space, and as an aid to meditation and entrainment. The work references the concept of the mandala as a microcosm of the universe and creates a digital version of this ancient symbol, generated by data and users. Once "#entity255" is up and running, its shape change and response to human interaction is handled by code. It draws its visual material from the vast universe of the Internet. In this sense, #entity255 evokes a "living" digital organism that absorbs and releases energy, responding to its surroundings without any preconceived barriers.</p>

<p>I was very attracted to this work both in its conception and in its final presentation.</p>

<h4>Week Three:</h4>
<p>This week I'm trying to settle on my theme, after thinking about it for the last two weeks I realised that the subject of the spiritual world is really too big and requires a fair amount of philosophical discernment and a lot of theory to back it up, so I've decided to change direction and go back to a question I've always had: the question of people's visual perceptions.

As an undergraduate I was deeply intrigued by the formation of visual order, especially in layout. Some seemingly haphazard elements can be combined with each other to magically create a sense of order, while others simply add to the visual chaos. The same pattern, the same colour, or even a few simple lines can inspire very different visual sensations in the eyes of different viewers. It's interesting, so I decided to take my theme in the direction of visual order. I'm travelling next week, so I've only decided on a general direction this week.</p>

<h4>Week Four:</h4>
<P>I've been travelling this week, and I have to say I'm really enjoying the natural beauty of the UK, the flowers of Canterbury and the White Cliffs of Dover have left a lasting impression on me, especially the White Cliffs of Dover on a rainy day, the feeling of being sparsely populated, coupled with the smell of rainy weather gives me a nostalgic vibe, and I'm really enjoying the atmosphere.</P>

<h3>July</h3>
<h4>Week one:</h4>
<p>This week I decided to delve deeper into the research in the direction that I have already set, but here I would like to say a few words about my thoughts, I think our perception of order is narrow.

Our perception of order is full of limitations, and it is restricted by various factors, such as experience, habits, perceptions, perspectives, and so on. At the same time, individual differences will have different results and effects on the perception of order.

I believe that order itself is always a selective attention to disorder, and due to the limitations of cognition, we may not be able to perceive the pattern that arises in a certain period of time, which leads to the creation of disorder. It is for this reason that I believe that disorder itself is flawed order.

Since I'm doing an Arduino installation on a similar topic in my first semester Arduino class, I still have some personal opinions on the topic, and all I need to do now is to go deeper into these concepts, find the appropriate theories to back them up, and think about the form of the final product. (At this point I don't realise how difficult this theme is :( , To watch this Arduino installation visit the link:https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/z4dzxcl2g8fvgtmwbgsbw/Physical-Computing-Project-Blog.paper?rlkey=v7cibfrw31qbncwknq5ttmznj&dl=0 )</p>

<h4>Week two:</h4>
<p>The main goal of this week was to brainstorm and do some mind mapping based on a previously identified topic, as well as find some papers related to the topic to use as theoretical support. Here are some drafts on the topic, some of which I had before, and re-reading them gave me an idea of some of my own thoughts at the time, as well as some new ones, though most of these were produced in Chinese for my own convenience.</p>

<p>In the meantime, based on the Arduino research, I'm no longer limited to Glass' (1969) "Moiré Effect from Random Dots", but I want to go deeper, and explore some of the principles behind the birth of moiré as a visual phenomenon, the so-called "visual order", and why it came about. I need to find some articles about this concept, which may involve biology.

Here I found a little trick, Glass (1969) "Moiré Effect from Random Dots" is included in PMC, so I just need to check who has cited this article, and then I can harvest relevant articles to check, this method works very well and saves me a lot of time. This method is very useful and saves me a lot of time.

This week I looked at the article on the formation and interpretation of moire patterns by Olof Bryngdahl (1974), and to be honest, there was a lot of stuff in there related to optics, photonics, etc. that was a bit of a mystery to me, so maybe I should try a different direction.</p>
