<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>If to someone had said to me before, "You'll learn about code and physical installations later on and use those things in your art installations." I would have laughed, I always felt I was a staunch advocate of traditional media and all the graphic work I did as an undergraduate made me embrace that idea even more, I never wanted to get out of that comfort zone. But one day when I realised the limitations of traditional media, I wanted to change. I wanted my work to be more interactive with the viewer, to communicate my ideas to the greatest extent possible, which traditional media could do in part, but as I learned more and more, I felt more and more powerless, so I turned from studying design to art, and then to what was 'beautiful'. But design, art and beauty all need a vehicle, a vehicle for diversity, and so I came to CCI.

In this blog, I'm going to describe in detail the process of creating my graduation project: "Order in Disorder" web-based interactive installation, which can be said to be one of the most difficult project experiences I can remember, bar none :D I can say that from the moment I decided on the theme to now, all the contents are full of challenges for me, but these challenges have made me progress very fast, and this kind of growth is not only my efforts alone, I also have a lot of people to help me from concept to completion, and this blog is a detailed record of the whole project. growth was not just my effort alone, I had the help of many people who helped me from concept to completion and this blog is a detailed account of the whole project.</p>

<h4>Week one:</h4>
<p>This is the last project of my graduate school years and I think I need to figure out what I need to do or what I want to do?

It was a free time due to the fact that I had submitted my final assignment for this semester, so I thought I needed to think about what I really needed to do, and I think that this kind of reflection is good for exploring the purpose of my rootedness.

In the initial topic idea stage, I filled in the form to explore ideas about the spiritual realm of beliefs and the like, and indeed I am very interested in this aspect of the topic, especially in the current social environment where people's spiritual world is incredibly empty (I like to refer to the current social environment as the "Floating World", where people become restless due to a lack of spiritual support). I like to call the current social environment "Fukiyo-e", where people become restless, turbulent and uneasy due to the lack of spiritual support. It seems to be peaceful, but in fact it is a "whitewash", most people's material desires are satisfied in stages, but the pursuit of greater material desires, they become spiritually empty, although this has something to do with the "social winds", but I think that at this stage it is better to let go and look at oneself). (Although this has something to do with "social trends", I think at this stage it's better to let go and look at oneself).

This week I have been reading some books, revisiting Camus's The Myth of Sisyphus, and reading some of Zizek's analyses of the concept of the Big Other, and I want to find a breakthrough in this area.</p>

<h4>Week two:</h4>
<p>Last week wasn't too substantial to be honest, I'm still unsure of the main direction I want to go in, the topic of the spiritual world is too vast and many philosophical books aren't fully comprehensible to me, so this week I decided to look at the work, I'm hoping that browsing through other people's work will give me some answers. I really liked Wellington Lux's work '#entity255', his concept is very interesting: the work explores the mandala as a spiritual concept, a way of creating sacred space, and as an aid to meditation and entrainment. The work references the concept of the mandala as a microcosm of the universe and creates a digital version of this ancient symbol, generated by data and users. Once "#entity255" is up and running, its shape change and response to human interaction is handled by code. It draws its visual material from the vast universe of the Internet. In this sense, #entity255 evokes a "living" digital organism that absorbs and releases energy, responding to its surroundings without any preconceived barriers.</p>

<p>I was very attracted to this work both in its conception and in its final presentation.</p>
