<h3>Introduction</h3>
If to someone had said to me before, "You'll learn about code and physical installations later on and use those things in your art installations." I would have laughed, I always felt I was a staunch advocate of traditional media and all the graphic work I did as an undergraduate made me embrace that idea even more, I never wanted to get out of that comfort zone.

But one day when I realised the limitations of traditional media, I wanted to change. I wanted my work to be more interactive with the viewer, to communicate my ideas to the greatest extent possible, which traditional media could do in part, but as I learned more and more, I felt more and more powerless, so I turned from studying design to art, and then to what was 'beautiful'. But design, art and beauty all need a vehicle, a vehicle for diversity, and so I came to CCI.

In this blog, I'm going to describe in detail the process of creating my graduation project: "Order in Disorder" web-based interactive installation, which can be said to be one of the most difficult project experiences I can remember, bar none :D I can say that from the moment I decided on the theme to now, all the contents are full of challenges for me, but these challenges have made me progress very fast, and this kind of growth is not only my efforts alone, I also have a lot of people to help me from concept to completion, and this blog is a detailed record of the whole project. growth was not just my effort alone, I had the help of many people who helped me from concept to completion and this blog is a detailed account of the whole project.
